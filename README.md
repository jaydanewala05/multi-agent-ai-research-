# 🤖 Multi-Agent AI Research Assistant

This project is a powerful research tool powered by **Groq** and a multi-agent architecture. It allows you to upload documents (PDFs) and use specialized AI agents to analyze, extract information, and answer complex queries.

## 🧠 The Agent Architecture
The system is divided into specialized agents to ensure high-quality research:

* **Orchestrator Agent:** The "brain" that coordinates tasks between other agents.
* **Research Agent:** Specialized in scanning documents and finding specific data points.
* **Analysis Agent:** Takes raw research and turns it into structured insights.
* **OCR/PDF Agent:** Handles the technical part of reading files and images.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Lightning Fast Inference:** Powered by Groq for near-instant responses.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Uses FAISS for efficient document searching.
- **OCR Support:** Can read text even from images or scanned PDFs.
- **Streamlit Interface:** A clean, user-friendly web UI.
